<h4 id="getting-started-tips">Getting started tips</h4>
<ul>
<li>Do not start from scratch, use an existing asset and modify it to learn how it works.</li>
<li>Explore the sources for ideas and sample code.</li>
<li>Use Firebug or Chrome Developer Tools to find bugs on your website. Using one of those tools will help you to save time analyzing the site and finding elements structure, like classes, id or tags<ul>
<li>Quick tip: open your site with Chrome, press F12 and go to console tab, reload your page and if something goes wrong you will see your page errors in red text.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In case of errors, someone might have seen it too, you can try a Google search for a quick fix.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important</strong> Opening the index.html with a double click (i.e. using file:// protocol) will show you only a blank page because thereâ€™s no server that response to the requests made for each view in order to display the app interface.</p>

<p>This structure is based on the provided by the <strong>create-react-app</strong> project. There are more files in the structure, we will list the main files in order to describe the application workflow based on the order they are imported.  </p>
<p>The application is bootstrapped in file <strong>public/index.html</strong>, this file includes the main application files compiled.</p>
<p>The application main file is <strong>src/index.js</strong> and it imports the App module and the translation setup.</p>
<p>The file <strong>App.js</strong> is where the main <strong>App</strong> module is defined and is used as the root element that starts the application, here is also imported the rest of the modules like routes, styles and global vendor dependencies</p>
<p>Routes are defined in file <strong>Routex.js</strong> that imports all components that are related to views displayed from the sidebar links.</p>
<p><strong>Vendor.js</strong> imports global dependencies like modernizr, styles, icon fonts, etc.</p>

<p>The following steps are intended to be an orientation guide, if you are not experienced with this you will need to learn a bit more about it from Google :)</p>
<ul>
<li>To install node and npm, go to <a href="http://nodejs.org/" title="http://nodejs.org/">http://nodejs.org/</a></li>
<li>Download and install GIT for your platform from <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have all tools installed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open a console/terminal and run <code>npm install</code> to install application dependencies</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally run <code>npm run start</code> to start the application development server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If everything goes fine, you should see the messages in the terminal telling you the application has been compiled and the server is running. </p>
<p>Open your browser and go to <strong><a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a></strong> </p>
<h4 id="building-for-production">Building for production</h4>
<p>The following will compile the application for the production:</p>
<pre><code>npm run build</code></pre><p>This will generate the compiled files under the folder <strong>build</strong></p>
<p>Check the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md">User Guide</a> online to know more about the create-react-app project.</p>
<p>If your application is not served from the root, before compilation, set the environment variable <strong>PUBLIC_URL</strong> and then run compilation.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>If your app is served from <a href="http://example.com/some/path">http://example.com/some/path</a> then use:</p>
<pre><code>set PUBLIC_URL=/some/path
npm run build</code></pre></div></article><article id="redux"><h2 class="title">Redux</h2><div class="content"><p>Redux is used mainly to manage application settings to change the layout options and themes. 
It&#39;s organized by files per  actions, reducers and middleware so you can easily remove them or add more according to your application needs.</p>
<p>Redux files are placed under <strong>src/store</strong> folder. In this folder you will find the following files:</p>
<pre><code>+---store
    +---actions
    |   +---actions.js
    |   +---setting.actions.js
    |   +---theme.actions.js
    +---middlewares
    |   +---middlewares.js
    |   +---setting.middleware.js
    |   +---theme.middleware.js
    +---reducers
    |   +---reducers.js
    |   +---setting.reducer.js
    |   +---theme.reducer.js
    +---persisted.store.js
    +---store.js</code></pre><p>The file <strong>store.js</strong> is imported into the <strong>index.js</strong> file which makes the store parts of the application by using the <Provider> component from react-redux. Removing that will remove Redux from the project automatically.</p>
<p>Notice that for each folder, there&#39;s a main file (actions/actions.js, reducers/reducers.js and middlewares/middlewares.js) which are the ones who import and exports each scripts to the rest of the application.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// src/index.js
...
import { Provider } from &#39;react-redux&#39;;
...
import configureStore from &#39;./store/store&#39;;
const store = configureStore();

ReactDOM.render(
    &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;
        &lt;App /&gt;
    &lt;/Provider&gt;,
    document.getElementById(&#39;app&#39;)
);</code></pre>
<p>We have created reducers for settings which contains state of the current layout options, like fixed, boxed, sidebar collapsed, and also the toggle for sidebar offcanvas on mobile and the sidebar user block. And for themes, which contains a single state with the current theme selected.</p>
<p>We have also used middlewares in order to hook into the redux state changes to modify the classes from dom elements (mainly body) and to change active the theme. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main use of Redux is done in the Offsidebar component, which provides the demo for layout settings and themes, in file <strong>src/components/Layout/Offsidebar.js</strong>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://redux.js.org/basics/usage-with-react#presentational-and-container-components">Container</a> components where omitted from the store structure as they don&#39;t match exactly our requirements but you can add them easily and import into your custom components.</p>
<h4 id="persisted-states">Persisted states</h4>
<p>In order to save the settings selected and the active theme, we have included a custom script named <strong>persisted.store.js</strong>. This script automatically saves the entire application state to the browser storage, and restores it when the app loads. </p>
<p>In order to apply the states from the storage the first time the application loads, is necessary to talk to middlewares we are who modify classes in the body. To achieve this, the middleware exports a method that receives the state and acts accordingly.
If you add states that don&#39;t perform changes in the Dom outside the app root element, you can omit this as it&#39;s not necessary.</p>
<p>Since not all state are suitable to be saved, we have used a black list that prevent some state to be saved, for example, the state used to toggle the sidebar on mobile. </p>
<p>The code that filter</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">/* Export a method to save state on each store update */
export const saveState = (state) =&gt; {
    try {
        let stateFilter = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(state)); // deep clone
        [&#39;offsidebarOpen&#39;, &#39;asideToggled&#39;, &#39;horizontal&#39;] // states which we don&#39;t want to persist.
        .forEach(item =&gt; delete stateFilter.settings[item])
        const rawState = JSON.stringify(stateFilter);
        localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, rawState);
    } catch (err) {
        // Ignore write errors.
    }
};</code></pre>
